# Donut-Maker

A game inspired by “Cookie Clicker” that allows users to acquire donuts by clicking a button and unlock achievements with required donut counts. The project was built with vanilla JavaScript for frontend and .Net Entity Framework Core API in C# for the data of certain challenges. CSS Animation is a core component of the project that is dynamically implemented by Javascript.
